                If you are looking for a good budget hotel right opposite the Naini Lake in Nainital, India Hotel is just the place for you. While you can book a stay in its exclusive terrace glassroom (a specialty here), it also has a number of cottages and suites with uninterrupted lake views. Its richly-furnished suites are spacious enough to accommodate small groups and families. Though the hotel kitchen doles out basic North Indian food, its location, service and affordability makes up for it. You want to travel the world or just visit the city down the road? Organise your journey through BeWelcome and meet nice people on the way...</p>
